This Repository contains tasks that were assigned to me during my virtual internship at CODSOFT

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                                                                  
TASK 1 :- A Simple Calculator in C++ .                                                                                                              

*Here I have implemented Object Orientation Concept.

Flow:-

->Created Class. 

->Characteristics are created under public access specifiers.

->parameterized constructor is used to intialize the characteristics.

->Calculations function is used for writing actual logic.

->Object is Created in main function.

->Function is Called with the help of object.

TASK 2 :- Number Guessing Game in C++ .

*Here I have implemented Object Orientation Concept.

FLOW:-

->Created Class Name NumberGuess. 

->Characteristics are created under public access specifiers.

->parameterized constructor is used to intialize the characteristics.

->Guessfunc function is used for writing actual logic.

->srand(time()) function is used to generate a seed or condition for rand() function here this seed is current time.

->rand() function is used to generate a number between 1 to 100 in our case, rand() function generate a different number whenever the program runs.  

->Object is Created in main function.

->Function is Called with the help of object.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TASK 3 :- Tic Tac Toe Game in C++

*Here I have implemented Pointer, Array, and Object Oriented Concepts

FLOW:-

->Created Class Name TicTacToe. 

->Characteristics are created under public access specifiers.

->parameterized constructor is used to intialize the characteristics.

->drawBoard() function is used to Display the game Grid on Console.

->Player1Move() function is used to accept the marker X and place into a single grid out of 9. 

->Player2Move() function is used to accept the marker O and place into a single grid out of 9.

->checkWinner() function is used to check winner of the game.

->checkTie() function is used to check whether their is Tie.  

->Object is Created in main function.

->Functions are Called with the help of object.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TASK 4 :- TO-DO LIST

*Here i have implemented the concept of array, conditional while loop, switch case and naked functions.

FLOW:-

->In main function i have created a array of string and counter to count the number of strings.

->with the help of conditional while loop and switch case, i created a menu of to-do list

->for case 1 i.e adding a task in list, ignore() function is used to ignore spaces in a line and getline function is used to get the input line or paragraph i.e string(task).

->for case 2 i.e viewing the tasks in to-do list, Display_Tasks() function is used to traverse the array and display the tasks.

->for case 3 i.e Deleting a task, simply the task number of the deleting task is assigned to the next task and the counter is decremented by 1.

->for case 4 i.e Marking the task as complete and removing it, IsComplete() function is used to traverse the array of string until the task to be marked is found and simply mark it as complete and then used the logic of delete to remove that task from to-do list.

->case 0 is for terminating the program.

->In this task i have learned some internal functions, function calling sequence and building of logics.
