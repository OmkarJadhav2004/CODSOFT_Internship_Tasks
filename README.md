TASK 1 :- A Simple Calculator in C++ .                                                                                                              

*Here I have implemented Object Orientation Concept.

Flow:-

->Created Class. 

->Characteristics are created under public access specifiers.

->parameterized constructor is used to intialize the characteristics.

->Calculations function is used for writing actual logic.

->Object is Created in main function.

->Function is Called with the help of object.

TASK 2 :- Number Guessing Game in C++ .

*Here I have implemented Object Orientation Concept.

FLOW:-

->Created Class Name NumberGuess. 

->Characteristics are created under public access specifiers.

->parameterized constructor is used to intialize the characteristics.

->Guessfunc function is used for writing actual logic.

->srand(time()) function is used to generate a seed or condition for rand() function here this seed is current time.

->rand() function is used to generate a number between 1 to 100 in our case, rand() function generate a different number whenever the program runs.  

->Object is Created in main function.

->Function is Called with the help of object.

TASK 3 :- Tic Tac Toe Game in C++

*Here I have implemented Pointer, Array, and Object Oriented Concepts

FLOW:-

->Created Class Name TicTacToe. 

->Characteristics are created under public access specifiers.

->drawBoard() function is used to Display the game Grid on Console.

->Player1Move() function is used to accept the marker X and place into a single grid out of 9. 

->Player2Move() function is used to accept the marker O and place into a single grid out of 9.

->checkWinner() function is used to check winner of the game.

->checkTie() function is used to check whether their is Tie.  

->Object is Created in main function.

->Functions are Called with the help of object.
