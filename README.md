TASK 1 :- A Simple Calculator in C++ .                                                                                                              

*Here I have implemented Object Orientation Concept.

Flow:-

->Created Class. 

->Characteristics are created under public access specifiers.

->parameterized constructor is used to intialize the characteristics.

->Calculations function is used for writing actual logic.

->Object is Created in main function.

->Function is Called with the help of object.

TASK 2 :- Number Guessing Game in C++ .

*Here I have implemented Object Orientation Concept.

FLOW:-

->Created Class Name NumberGuess. 

->Characteristics are created under public access specifiers.

->parameterized constructor is used to intialize the characteristics.

->Guessfunc function is used for writing actual logic.

->srand(time()) function is used to generate a seed or condition for rand() function here this seed is current time.

->rand() function is used to generate a number between 1 to 100 in our case, rand() function generate a different number whenever the program runs.  

->Object is Created in main function.

->Function is Called with the help of object.
